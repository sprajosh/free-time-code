# Auto Login - Browser Automation
This bit of code has a nice story behind it but I don't think you would want to know that.

This can be used as a sample code for browser automation as I've used most of the commonly used automation functions.

###### Packages required: 
time, urllib2, splinter


###### Why these packages
**time** to check how much time it took to run the program

**urllib2** to open the website and access the page

**splinter** to specify what I wanted to do (browser automation work)

###### Ubuntu commands to install packages:
`pip install time urllib2 splinter`
